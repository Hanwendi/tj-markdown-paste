        ## What is Markdown?

        [Markdown] is a lightweight markup language based on the formatting conventions that people naturally use in email. As [John Gruber] writes on the [Markdown site][markdown]:

        >   The overriding design goal for Markdown's
        >   formatting syntax is to make it as readable 
        >   as possible. The idea is that a
        >   Markdown-formatted document should be
        >   publishable as-is, as plain text, without
        >   looking like it's been marked up with tags
        >   or formatting instructions.

        ## What is Tex

        [TeX] is a typesetting system designed and mostly written by [Donald Knuth],
        and also is a popular means by which to typeset complex mathematical formula.
