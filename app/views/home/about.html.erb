## What is Markdown?

[Markdown] is a lightweight markup language based on the formatting conventions that people naturally use in email.  As [John Gruber] writes on the [Markdown site][markdown]:

> The overriding design goal for Markdown's
> formatting syntax is to make it as readable 
> as possible. The idea is that a
> Markdown-formatted document should be
> publishable as-is, as plain text, without
> looking like it's been marked up with tags
> or formatting instructions.

## What is Tex

[TeX] is a typesetting system designed and mostly written by [Donald Knuth],
and also is a popular means by which to typeset complex mathematical formula.
