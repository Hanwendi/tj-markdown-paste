# TJMarkdownPaste

It's really common to see an online markdown editor, but most of them don't have features for publishing or sharing. However, it's still common to just add only a publish feature.

It's cool to have automatic code hightlight, isn't it?

    #include<stdio.h>
    int main(int argc, char* argv[]){
      printf("Hello, TJMarkdownPaste");
      return 0;
    }

Ruby code:

    def ruby_code
      cool_boy = name: "tonytonyjan", age: 18
    end

And what about some mathematic syntax?

$J\_\alpha(x) = \sum\limits\_{m=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^m}{m! \, \Gamma(m + \alpha + 1)}{\left({\frac{x}{2}}\right)}^{2 m + \alpha}$
